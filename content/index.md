## Notice
Since obsidian supported plugins, such as DataView, some Latex Features, Image Resizing, Banners, are not yet supported by Quartz, some pages might be broken. I will try my best to write my notes in a way that is supported by both Quartz and Obsidian! If you would like to see the obsidian vault that I designed, simply download this repository from Github, and open up the `content` folder as vault.
