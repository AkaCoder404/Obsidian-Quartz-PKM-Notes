# My Second Brain

Welcome to my second brain! Here is a collection of my notes mainly in Computer Science. 

## Notable Pages
Here is a collection of my notable pages.
- [[Data Science]]
- [[Neural Networks]]
- [[Convolutional Neural Network]]
- [[Recurrent Neural Network]]
- [[Transformers]]
- [[Machine Learning]]
## Notice
Since obsidian supported plugins, such as DataView, some Latex Features, Image Resizing, Banners, are not yet supported by Quartz, some pages might be broken. I will try my best to write my notes in a way that is supported by both Quartz and Obsidian! If you would like to see the obsidian vault that I designed, simply download this repository from Github, and open up the `content` folder as vault.
