# Residual Network
A [[Convolutional Neural Network]] architecture.
## Residual Blocks

Residual Blocks allows you to train much deeper networks. 
## Plain Network vs Residual Network

Helps with [[Vanishing and Exploding gradient problem]]. Helps in training much deeper networks.

Why doesn't it hurt performance? It maintains identify function, which is essential just a single layer.

While in plain networks, it's hard to learn the identity function, which may hurt the performance.
