# Logistic Regression
***What is logistic regression?*** 
- Binary Classifications
- if you need probabilistic results (probability of output is part of a class)
- Logistic Loss Functions
- Multi-class Classifications

***Applications?***
- Predicting the probability of a person having a heart attack
- Predicting the mortality in injured patients
- Predicting a customer's propensity to purchase a product or a halt a subscription
- Predicting the probability of failure given a process or product
- Predict the likelihood of a homeowner defaulting on a mortgage
