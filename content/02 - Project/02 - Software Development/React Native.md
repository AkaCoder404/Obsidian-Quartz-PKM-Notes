Using react native components, with using JSX components

```javascript
<View> // uses flexbox by default
<TouchableOpacity> // Button
<ActivityIndicator>  // Loading Indicator
<Flatlist> // For larger list
// map function for smaller
<ScrollView> // navigate through list of image
```

- In-memory storage
- State management
- Storage/Database

### Code Coverage
Here is an example setting up code coverage in a React Native project. First let's configure `jest` for React Native, which should be installed by default. However, we have to configure `jest.config.js` with the following code.
```js
"jest": { 
	"preset": "react-native", 
	"collectCoverage": true 
}
```
Then in order to ensure tests and coverage works, run `npm test -- --coverage`. This should give something like this.


Here, we show how to use ![Codecov]

Then you should see this in installed apps

**3. Integrate the code coverage service with your github repository**
For GitHub Actions, you can add a step in your `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
-   name: Upload coverage to Codecov 
	uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2 
	with: token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }} # Not required for public repos 
	file: ./coverage/lcov.info 
	flags: unittests name: codecov-umbrella
```

Generate the token here

Place secrets here, create new organization secret called `CODECOV_TOKEN`
