# 01 Key Takeaways
AWS is a **Cloud Service Provider** (CSP).
- No longer need to buy the infrastructure... paying only for what you need
- On demand delivery and cloud deployments, pay as you go pricing model
- Benefits of AWS Cloud Computing
	- trade upfront expense for variable expense
	- stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
	- stop guessing capacity
	- benefit from massive economies of scale
	- increase speed and agility
	- go global in minutes

Key-terms
- Cloud Service Provider (CSP)
- Technical Account Manager (TAM)
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
-  AWS DAX Accelerator
- AWS Service Control Policies (SCP)

**Cloud Service Provider**
if an organization has the skills to build and manage its cloud environment and solutions itself, then it may only want to access the sstandard cloud services from the CSP, like AWS or a cloud reseller

**Cloud Adoption Parts**
- **Procurement** - pricing, security, data soveriengty/residency, sustainability, governance, terms and conditions
- **Legal**
- **Security**
- **Governance**
- **Finance**
- **Compliance**

**AWS Partner Network**
The AWS Partner Network (APN) is a global community of partners that leverage Amazon Web Services (AWS) to build solutions and services for customers. The APN helps companies build, market, and sell their AWS offerings by providing valuable business, technical, and marketing support. The network is divided into two primary types of partners: Consulting Partners and Technology Partners. Each plays a unique role in the AWS ecosystem.
- **Consulting Partners** - Consulting Partners are professional services firms that help customers of all types and sizes design, architect, build, migrate, and manage their workloads and applications on AWS. 
- **Technology Partners**. Technology Partners provide hardware, connectivity services, or software solutions that are either hosted on, or integrated with, the AWS platform.

**Payment Options**
- **On-demand** - only pay for the duration the instance runs for 
- **Saving's plan** - low prices in exchange for consistent amount of usage measured in dollars per hour for a one or three year term (up to 72%) 
- **Reserved Instance** - suited for steady-state workloads or ones with predictable usage and offer you up to a 75 versus On-Demand pricing. You qualify for a discount once you comit to a one or a three-year term and can pay for them with three payment options (all upfront, partial upfront, and no upfront). Require you to specify instance family and size, platform, tenancy, and region. Reserved Instances are a billing discount that is applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in an AWS account. A business can purchase Standard Reserved and Convertible Reserved Instances for a 1-year or 3-year term. Unlike EC2 Instance Savings Plans, Reserved Instances do not require an hourly spend commitment over the duration of the contract term - stndard reserve instances allows you to modify the AZ, scope, networking type, and instance size (within the same instance type)
- **Convertible Reserved Instance** - enables you to exchange one or more convertible reserved instances for another convertible reserved instance with a different configuration, including instance family, operaing systems, and tenancy
- **Spot Instances** - allow you to request spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity for up to 90% off of the O-nDemand price. The catch here is that AWS can reclaim the instance at any time they need it, giving you a two-minute warning to finish up work and save state. You can always resume later if needed. So when choosing Spot Instances, make sure your workloads can tolerate being interrupted. A good example of those are batch workloads, access to unused EC2 capacit
- **Dedicated Hosts** - Physical hosts dedicated for your use of EC2. 
**Scaling Amazon EC2**
- Scalability and Elasticity - growth and shrink of capacity
- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling enables you to automatically add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to changing application demand.
	- Dynamic Scaling responses to changing demand
	- Predictive Scaling automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.
	- Minimum, Desired, and Maximum Capacity
- Scaling Up -> more power to the machines that are running.
- Scale out ->

# 05 AWS Global Infrastructure
In order to provide high availability and fault tolerance, aws operates in all sort of different areas called **regions**. Each region is connected to another region through high speed fiber network, and within each region, there are multiple data centers (or multiple groups of data centers) called **availability zones**. Users, when launching instances, get to choose which region and zone their services operate in.

- availability zones - regions are made up of multiple data center, one single or group of data center is called a availability zone, availability zones are spread out across the region in case of disasters. run multiple EC2 instances in different availability zones (recommended at least two)
- What if you have customers all over the world? some customers might not be close to the main data to
	- caching copies of data closer to the customers all aroudn the world -> Content Delver Networks (CDN) - **Amazon Cloudfront** Helps deliver data to custoemrs around the world
- Amazon Cloudfront also run a DNS called Amazon Route 53, helping direct customers to the correct web locations with low latency.
- **AWS Outposts** - AWS install a fully operationall mini region in your own data centers, isolated to a single building.

## AWS Networking
![Complexities of AWS Security Groups in the Cloud World](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5612AQEC2sdz3KYSVg/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1677177668817?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=3EaBtGaRHdknsiczlvzsv_F3nalL2KZ4cxG8UGzJp88)
**Amazon Virtual Private Cloud** - allows you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtu. l network that you define.
- These resources can be public facing so they have access to the internet, or private with no internet access.
- public vs private subnet
- allows you define private ip range for AWS resources 
- subnets allow you to group services together.
- subnets must stay entirely within one availability zone

**Internet Gateway** - public facing 
- provide a target in your VPC routing table for internet routable traffic
- perform NAT for instances that have been assigned IPv4 address
**Virtual Private Gateway** - VPN connection from 
- private but still use regular connection, share bandwith with other people using internet
**Network Access Control Lists** - stateless (checks all packets regardless of any circumstance) -> every ingress/egress packets all checked, initially allows all ingress/outgress. Also performs DDOS prevention, Data Integrity, Encryption, Authentication and Authorization
**Access Control Lists**
**Security Groups** - By default, security group blocks all ports, preventing traffic and must be modified to allow inbound/outbound. It is stateful, meaning it allows all return traffic without having to recheck list.

## Account Management
- AWS account root user -> owner of aws account, permission to do anything, recommended to turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for root user
- **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** By default, a new user has zero permission (not even logging in), give granular permissions to all users
- Least privlage principle - users are granted IAM policy to an IAM user, a JSON document which describes API calls a user can or cannot make.
- **IAM Policy** - a document that allows or denies permissions to AWS services and resources.
- **IAM Groups** - attaching policies to groups of users
- **IAM Roles** - associated permissions that allowr or deny, assumed for temporary amounts of time, no users or passwords, access to temporary permissions to AWS resources, users, external identities, applications, or other AWS services. When  an identiy assumes a role, it abondons all previous permissions.
	- Task Role
	- Web Identity Role
	- Service Role
	- Instance Role - Grant acess to specific instances
- **Identity Federation** - allow existing identities (users, groups, and roles) in your enterprise to access the AWS Management Console, call AWS APIs, and access resources, without the need to create an IAM user for each identity.

> [!wawrning] Do not use the root user for everyday tasks
> Instead, use the root user to create your first IAM user and assign it permissions to create other users. Only use the root user for specific tasks.

Practices
- rotate credentials regularily
- enable multi-factor authentication
- delete all root user keys

Identities
- Roles
- Groups

**AWS Organizations**
- a central location to manage multiple AWS accounts.
- consolidated billing
- hierarchical groupings of accounts
- AWS service and API actions access control for each individual user- **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** - can be applied to an individual member account or an organizational unit (OU)
- volume discounts

**Compliance**
- Ex Regulations- General Data Protection Regulation in Europe, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in US
- AWS has already built out data center infrastructure and networking following industry best practices for security, and as an AWS customer, you inherit all the best practices of AWS policies, architecture, and operational processes. 
- AWS assurance programs
- **AWS Compliance** - information about compliance services and documents
- Coustomer Complience Cente

## Migration and Innovation
Migration and Innovation
**Migration Strategies** 
The 6 R's - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/6-strategies-for-migrating-applications-to-the-cloud/
1. **Rehosting** - lift and shift, pick and move applications as is to aws
2. **Replatforming** - lift, tinker, and shift, make a few cloud optimizations, no new applications changes / no code changes, such as moving local mysql to RDS mysql
3. **Retire** - turn off deprecated / unused parts of the application
4. **Retain** - migrate only what makes sense
5. **Repurchasing** - abandon legacy software vendors and moving to a new one
6. **Refactoring** - rewriting code and dramatic changes to architectr

# 04 Services
