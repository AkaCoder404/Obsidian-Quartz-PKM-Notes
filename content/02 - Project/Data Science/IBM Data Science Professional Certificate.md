## 03 Data Science Methodology
![[Pasted image 20230720180752.png]]
Data science methodology can be represented with a total of 10 stages, however, it is cyclic and an iterative process!
1. Business Understanding
2. Analytic Approach - identifying what type of patterns will be needed to address the question most effectively
3. Data Requirements - identify the necessary data contents, formats, and sources for initial classification
4. Data Collection - techniques to assess the content, quality, and initial insights about the data
5. Data Understanding - is the data you collected representative of the problem to be solved?
6. Data Preparation - what are the ways in which data is prepared? 
7. Modeling - in what way can the data be visualized to get the answer that is required? 
8. Evaluation - does the model used really answer the initial question or does it need to be adjusted?
9. Deployment
10. Feedback

Imagine the case study: 

*What is hospital readmissions?* A situation where you were discharged from the hospital and wind up going back in the same or related care within 30 days.

**Modeling**
1. The **positive** non-readmission
2. The **negative** is readmission

TP. Person is correctly classified for non-readmission.
FP. Person is incorrectly classified for non-readmission.
TN. Person is correctly classified for readmission.
FN. Person is incorrectly classified for readmission

If FP occurs, resources are wasted, cost is high.
If FN occurs, those that need help do not get it.

### Data Wrangling
1. Dealing with missing values
	1. check with data collection source
	2. drop the variable, data entry
	3. replace the missing values, with average, frequency, etc
	4. leave it as missing data
2. Data formatting
3. Data normalization
	1. 1. simple feature calling
	2. min-max
	3. z-score
4. Binning
	1. group values into "bins"
	2. converts numeric into categorical variables
	3. group a set of numerical values into  a set of bins

### Exploratory Data Analysis
It is a preliminary step in data analysis to
- summarize main characteristics
- gain better understanding of the data set
- uncover relationships between variables
- extract important variables

## 06 Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
Learn the *basics of sql* and *relational database model*

**What is SQL**? A language used for relational database. 

**What is a Relational Database?**

**DBMS?**

**DDL?** Data definition language are used to define, change, or drop database object. Including CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE
**DML?** Read and modify data. Including INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE


Select from table
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
SELECT col1, col2 FROM table_name
SELECT col1, col2 FROM table_name WHERE col1 = value1

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name 
SELECT DISTINCT col1 FROM table_name WHERE col1 = value1
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 1
```

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name 
	(col1, ...)
VALUES
	(val1, ...);
```

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET col1 = value1, col2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition
```


```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
	WHERE col1 in (val1, val2)
```

Create table
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name
	(
	col_name datatype optional_parameter
	...
	)
```

Alter table
```SQL
ALTER TABLE table_name
	ADD COLUMN col_name datatype;

ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE col_name
	col_name datatype

ALTER TABLE table_name
	ALTER COLUMN col_name SET DATATYPE CHAR(20)

ALTER TABLE table_name
	DROP COLUMN col_name
```

Delete table
```
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

Delete all rows
```
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name IMMEDIATE;
```

String Patterns, Ranges, Sets of Values
```
... WHERE column LIKE R%
... WHERE pages between ... AND ...
... WHERE country IN (..., ..., ...)
```

Sorting
```sql
... ORDER BY col_name ASC/DESC
... ORDER BY col_num 
```

Grouping Results Sets
```sql
SELECT col_name, COUNT(col_name) FROM table_name GROUP BY col_name AS new_col_name HAVING COUNT(col_name) > X
```

Built-in Database Functions
- Aggregate Functions - perform operations on entire cols, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX
- Scalar Functions - perform operations on every value: ROUND, LENGTH, UCASE, LCASE
- Date and Time - special data types for dates and times: YEAR, MONTH, DAY, DAYOFMONTH

Sub-queries and Nested Selects
A query inside another query. 
- subqueries to evaluate aggregate functions
- subqueries in a list of columns
- subqueries in from clause
```sql
SELECT col1 FROM table_name
	WHERE col2 = (SELECT ... FROM table_name)

```

Working with Multiple Tables
Access multiple tables in the same query
1. Sub-queries
2. Implicit Join
3. JOIN operators (INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN, etc)
```SQL
SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
WHERE column_name OPERATOR
   (SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
   FROM table1 [, table2 ]
   WHERE condition);
```

**What is Python DB-API**?

**What is a Model?** A model can be thought of as a mathematical equation used to predict a value given one or more other values. Relating one or more independent variables to dependent variables.

**Model Evaluation and Refinement?**
